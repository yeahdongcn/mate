"""Native MUSA tilelang kernel for the SSD inter-chunk state passing (stage 3).

This is stage 3 of the Mamba2/SSD chunked prefill. The intra-chunk states of the
previous stage are scanned **across** chunks, sequentially within a sequence and
in parallel across (sequence, head):

    running = entering_state(sequence, c)        # fp32
    running = exp(dA_cumsum[h, c, L-1]) * running + states[c, h]
    out[c, h] = running                          # rounded to state_dtype on store

Two boundary rules are supported, selected by a runtime flag so one compiled
kernel covers both:

* **``seq_idx``** (``seq_idx is not None``), the rule the device oracle uses:
  chunks are visited in index order, a sequence's first chunk enters from
  ``initial_states[seq_idx[c]]`` and every later chunk with that ``seq_idx``
  continues the sequence's running state. Chunks assigned to other sequences in
  between are skipped without decaying it, so one sequence's physical chunks need
  not be contiguous -- and ``initial_states`` is indexed by the **value** of
  ``seq_idx``, not by sequence position.
* **``last_chunk_indices``** arithmetic (``seq_idx is None``), the rule the
  shipped Triton kernel uses: ``chunk_end = last_chunk_indices[b] + 1`` and
  ``chunk_start = last_chunk_indices[b-1] + 1``, with ``b == 0`` starting at 0; a
  sequence with zero chunks (``last_chunk_indices[b] == -1``) iterates zero times
  and ``initial_states`` is indexed by sequence position.

The two agree whenever the caller's metadata is contiguous and consistent, which
is what the packed prefill path produces.

Both ``states`` and ``out`` are ``[nchunks, heads, dim, dstate]``; ``states`` is
fp32 and ``out`` is written in ``state_dtype``. ``initial_states`` is
``[batch, heads, dim, dstate]`` in any float dtype -- it is upcast to fp32 on
load -- and ``None`` means zero, selected by a runtime flag so one compiled kernel
covers both cases.

The decay is ``exp2(dA_cumsum * log2(e))``, the ``fast_exp`` of the shipped
implementation, and there is no ``min(..., 0)`` clip here: the cumsum is
non-positive under the documented ``A <= 0`` sign convention. The whole
recurrence stays in fp32 registers; only the store rounds, so the values written
for chunk ``c`` are the state **entering chunk ``c+1``**.

Dataflow (one CTA owns ``rows_per_cta`` consecutive ``dim`` rows of one head and
one sequence, and one warp lane group owns ``dstate / lanes_per_row`` consecutive
state columns of a row): the recurrence lives in per-thread registers, so the
kernel needs no shared memory and no cross-warp synchronization. Loads past the
``dim`` boundary are masked by branching around the address rather than
selecting, because the kernel is compiled with bounds checking disabled and an
out-of-range address must never be formed.

"""Public MUSA-native mamba/SSU API.

``selective_state_update`` is the decode-side entry point consumed by the
FlashInfer-shaped compatibility wrapper (``flashinfer.mamba``) in a MUSA build
whose provider is MATE. It implements the selective state update natively in
tilelang and mirrors the reference contract exactly for the supported
configuration.

Two kernels share this entry point, and the call shape picks between them:

- one token per sequence with no acceptance counts and no slot table
  (``ssu_one_token``) -- the plain decode step, which vLLM's Mamba2 mixer makes on
  every step, so it keeps the shape it was built for;
- everything else (``ssu_packed_varlen``): packed variable-length rows described by
  ``cu_seqlens``, one token per sequence per speculative position, a per-token
  destination slot table, and the acceptance count that seeds the read slot. This is
  the MTP decode call, and its state chain is what makes speculative decoding work.

Supported today:

- ``state`` fp16/bf16/fp32 ``[slots, heads, dim, dstate]``, contiguous
- ``x``/``B``/``C``/``z`` fp16 or bf16; ``dt``/``A``/``D``/``dt_bias`` fp32
- per-head (tied) ``A``, ``D`` and ``dt_bias``, i.e. ``A[h]`` broadcasting over
  ``dim``/``dstate``, which is the layout the Mamba2 consumers pass
- ``state_batch_indices``/``dst_state_batch_indices`` as a ``[sequences]`` vector or
  a ``[sequences, steps]`` table, ``cu_seqlens``, ``num_accepted_tokens``
- 3-D packed ``x`` ``[rows, heads, dim]`` and the dense 4-D
  ``[batch, steps, heads, dim]`` form of it
- ``pad_slot_id`` and ``disable_state_update`` honoured in kernel

Everything else raises ``NotImplementedError`` naming the missing capability
rather than silently narrowing semantics. Not implemented yet: stochastic rounding
(``rand_seed``), quantized state (``state_scale``), intermediate/replay state
capture (``intermediate_*``, and ``cache_steps`` outside the packed form where
FlashInfer defines it as the sequence length), and channel-wise ``D``/``dt_bias``.

Graph capture: the tilelang kernel is compiled on first use for each
(dtype, shape, flag) tuple. Call :func:`prewarm_selective_state_update` during
warmup, outside any capture context — a first-call compile inside a captured
graph stalls the worker (see `.claude/rules/tilelang-musa.md`). The op itself
issues a single kernel launch, allocates nothing when ``out`` is provided, and
performs no host/device scalar copies.

    The five stages run as five tilelang launches with per-shape scratch taken

    returned state tensor.

    Contract, matching vLLM's Mamba2 prefill caller:

    - ``x`` is ``[tokens, heads, dim]`` and ``dt`` is ``[tokens, heads]``, both
      packed over the flattened (variable-length) batch;
    - ``cu_chunk_seqlens`` is the only authority for the chunk-to-token mapping:
      chunk ``c`` covers ``[cu_chunk_seqlens[c], cu_chunk_seqlens[c+1])``. A chunk
      never spans two sequences, and every chunk but the last of a sequence spans
      ``chunk_size`` tokens;
    - ``last_chunk_indices[b]`` is the ordinal of sequence ``b``'s last logical
      chunk and ``seq_idx[c]`` is the request owning chunk ``c``. A chunk opens a
      sequence when ``seq_idx`` differs from the previous chunk's, and that
      transition -- not the ``last_chunk_indices`` arithmetic -- decides where the
      entering state comes from. The two can be made to disagree only by an
      inconsistent caller, and the two independent implementations of this
      contract resolve that disagreement differently, so ``seq_idx`` is the
      authority;
    - ``out`` is written in place when supplied;
    - the return value is a single tensor: the full ``[nchunks, heads, dim,
      dstate]`` state buffer when ``return_intermediate_states``, otherwise
      ``states[last_chunk_indices]`` with shape ``[batch, heads, dim, dstate]``,
      both in ``state_dtype`` (which defaults to ``initial_states.dtype``, else

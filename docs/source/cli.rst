   MATE CLI Reference <mate_cli>

MATE provides a command-line interface for validating the runtime environment,
inspecting resolved configuration, viewing environment variables, inspecting
registered JIT or AOT modules, exporting compile commands for development
tools, installing pre-generated kernel artifacts, clearing caches, and replaying
captured dumps.

Quick Reference
---------------

View all available commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate --help

If the ``mate`` executable entrypoint is not available in your environment, use
``python -m mate --help`` and ``python -m mate ...`` for supported subcommands.

For the full command reference, see :doc:`MATE CLI Reference <mate_cli>`.

Environment and Status
----------------------

Use these commands first after installation or when runtime behavior does not
match expectations.

Validate the runtime environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate check

Inspect resolved configuration, package versions, detected devices,
architecture resolution, and JIT or AOT state:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate show-config

Show the MATE-related environment variables visible to the current shell:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate env

JIT and Development Tools
-------------------------

Inspect the registered JIT and AOT modules without compiling them:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate module-status
   mate module-status --detailed

List all registered modules, or inspect one module in more detail:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate list-modules
   mate list-modules module_name

Export ``compile_commands.json`` for IDEs and language servers such as
``clangd`` or ``ccls``:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate export-compile-commands
   mate export-compile-commands my_compile_commands.json

Cache Management
----------------

Install the optional ``mate-mubin`` wheel matching the running MATE version:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate install-mubin-wheel

Clear the runtime JIT cache without removing packaged AOT libraries:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate clear-cache

MUBIN Artifacts
---------------

Manage MUBIN artifacts for wrapper-backed attention and GEMM paths:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate download-mubin
   mate list-mubins
   mate clear-mubin

These commands use the same artifact directory as the MUBIN runtime helpers.
See :doc:`Diagnostics <diagnostics>` if a path cannot find its artifacts.

Replay Recorded Calls
---------------------

Replay API dumps captured with Level 10 logging.

List recorded dump directories under a dump root:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate list-dumps mate_dumps/

Replay all recorded calls in a dump session:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate replay --dir mate_dumps/

Replay a single recorded call:

.. code-block:: bash

   mate replay --dir mate_dumps/<dump_directory>

``mate replay`` accepts either the dump root directory or a single dump
subdirectory.

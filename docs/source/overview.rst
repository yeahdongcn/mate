Overview
========

MUSA AI Tensor Engine (MATE) accelerates generative AI workloads on Moore
Threads GPUs by providing high-performance operator implementations,
especially Attention and GEMM, along with compatibility wrappers for selected
CUDA-oriented Python operator interfaces.

For a deeper explanation of how MATE is structured, see
:doc:`Design and Architecture <design_and_architecture>`.

Key Principles
--------------

- Wrapper-first: when a wrapper matches your existing package surface, keep
  the upstream import path and high-level API shape as stable as possible.
- Direct API fallback: use MATE Python APIs when no wrapper matches your
  workload or wrapper coverage is insufficient.
- Diagnostics early: verify the runtime with ``mate check``,
  ``mate show-config``, and ``mate env`` before debugging deeper failures.

Key Goals
---------

- Run high-performance generative AI workloads on Moore Threads GPUs with
  optimized Attention and GEMM operators.
- Reduce migration work for CUDA-oriented integrations by preserving familiar
  package surfaces when wrapper coverage exists.
- Provide a clear path from installation to wrapper selection, runtime
  verification, and failure diagnosis.
- Surface actionable debug artifacts, including logs, configuration, dumps,
  and replay data, when an integration fails.

Typical Workflow
----------------

1. Prepare a supported runtime.

   Start with a MUSA-enabled ``torch`` / ``torch_musa`` stack.

2. Choose the integration surface.

   Start with FlashAttention-3, SageAttention, FlashMLA, MSA/fmha_sm100,
   FlashKDA, or DeepGEMM when one matches your framework surface.

3. Install the delivered package.

   Install the matching wrapper from the wheel source when possible. The
   wrapper pulls in the matching ``mate`` package automatically. Install
   ``mate`` directly when no wrapper matches.

4. Verify the runtime.

   Run ``mate check``, ``mate show-config``, and ``mate env``.

5. Debug or fall back to APIs.

   If wrapper coverage does not meet your needs, continue with MATE Python
   APIs.

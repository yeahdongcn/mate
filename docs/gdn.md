# MATE Gated Delta Network (GDN) Support Matrix

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Gated Delta Network
(GDN) features, data types, and execution backends currently supported in
MATE. Use this matrix to verify configuration compatibility for production
deployment and optimization.

## Overview

MATE provides optimized kernels for Gated Delta Networks (GDN). MATE splits
GDN execution into two primary phases:

- Prefill: high-throughput processing of prompt contexts.
- Decode: low-latency generation, including standard single-token streaming
  and multi-token prediction (MTP).

## Decode

### Dispatch Matrix

| `state_layout` | `state.dtype` | `T` | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `VK` | `bfloat16` | `1` | ❌ Not supported | Single-token BF16-state decode is not implemented yet |
| `VK` | `bfloat16` | `> 1` | ✅ Supported | TileLang MTP path, currently K=V=128 |
| `VK` | `float32` | `1` | ✅ Supported | Current active decode path |
| `VK` | `float32` | `> 1` | ✅ Supported | TileLang MTP path, currently K=V=128 |
| `KV` | `float32` | `1` | ❌ Not supported | KV backend is not implemented yet |
| `KV` | anything else | any | ❌ Not supported | Unsupported combination |

### Current MATE Active Path

Current MATE decode support is intentionally narrow:

- API: `mate.gated_delta_rule_decode(...)`
- Supported combinations:
  - `state_layout="VK"`, `state.dtype=float32`, `T=1`
  - `state_layout="VK"`, `state.dtype=float32`, `T>1`, `K=V=128`
  - `state_layout="VK"`, `state.dtype=bfloat16`, `T>1`, `K=V=128`
- Backend: TileLang
- State update: in place

### Current MATE Restrictions

| Item | MATE |
| --- | --- |
| `state_indices` | ✅ Supported on VK FP32 decode and VK MTP; negative entries are padding |
| BF16 state backend | ✅ Supported on VK MTP (`T>1`, `K=V=128`) |
| KV backend | ❌ Not supported |
| MTP (`T > 1`) | ✅ Supported for VK float32/bfloat16 state with K=V=128 |
| `intermediate_states_buffer` | ✅ Supported on VK MTP; dtype must match `state.dtype` |
| `disable_state_update` | ✅ Supported on VK MTP |

### Input Contract on the Active Path

On the currently supported MATE path:

- `q / k / v`: `float16` or `bfloat16`
- `A_log`: `float32`
- `dt_bias`: `float32` or `bfloat16`
- `a / b`: same dtype as `q`
- `state`: `float32` for single-token decode; `float32` or `bfloat16` for MTP
- `intermediate_states_buffer`: same dtype as `state`
- `output`: optional, supports `float16` / `bfloat16` / `float32`

## Prefill

### Prefill At a Glance

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend | ✅ Supported | FlashInfer-aligned native MP31 prefill path on MUSA via `mate.gdn_prefill.chunk_gated_delta_rule` |
| Sequence Mode | ✅ Supported | Dense prefill without `cu_seqlens` and varlen prefill with `cu_seqlens` |
| Head Layout | ✅ Supported | `GQA` and `GVA` |
| Dtype (Q/K/V) | ✅ Supported | `fp16`, `bf16` |
| Gate Inputs | ✅ Supported | `g` and `beta` are float32 tensors; defaults to all-ones when omitted |
| Gate Space | ✅ Supported | `is_log_space=True` treats `g` as `log(alpha)`; `is_log_space=False` treats `g` as alpha in `(0, 1]` |
| Initial State | ✅ Supported | Optional `initial_state` with shape `[batch, head_sab, dim_v, dim_k]` (float32) |
| Final State Output | ✅ Supported | `output_final_state=True` returns `(output, final_state)` |
| Output Heads | ✅ Supported | `head_o = max(num_q_heads, num_v_heads)` |
| QK L2 Norm Option | ✅ Supported | `use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel=True` normalizes Q and K in place with a standalone TileLang kernel before KKT/prefill |
| Strided Q/K/V | ✅ Supported | Split-QKV views are supported when the last dimension is contiguous (`stride(-1) == 1`) |

### Prefill Shape Rules

`H_qk` is the number of Q/K heads, `H_v` is the number of value/output heads,
and `D` is the current Q/K/V head dimension.

| Input or output | Dense | Varlen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q`, `k` | `[B, T, H_qk, D]` | `[S, H_qk, D]` or `[1, S, H_qk, D]` |
| `v` | `[B, T, H_v, D]` | `[S, H_v, D]` or `[1, S, H_v, D]` |
| `g`, `beta` | `[B, T, H_v]` | `[S, H_v]` or `[1, S, H_v]` |
| `cu_seqlens` | `None` | Cumulative sequence lengths with shape `[B + 1]` |
| Output | `[B, T, H_v, D]` | `[S, H_v, D]` or `[1, S, H_v, D]`, matching the input rank |

For both modes:

- Q, K, and V must have the same token count and Q and K must have the same
  head dimension.
- `GQA` requires `num_v_heads == num_k_heads` and
  `num_q_heads % num_k_heads == 0`. `GVA` requires
  `num_q_heads == num_k_heads` and `num_v_heads % num_q_heads == 0`.
- `chunk_size` must be exactly `64` on the current native path.
- Q, K, and V may be non-contiguous split views, but each must satisfy
  `stride(-1) == 1`.
- If `use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel=True`, Q and K are modified in place before the
  KKT solve and fused prefill launch.

### Minimal Dense Prefill Example

Dense prefill uses 4D Q/K/V tensors and does not provide `cu_seqlens`:

```python
import torch
import mate

batch_size, num_tokens = 2, 128
num_qk_heads, num_v_heads, head_dim = 2, 2, 128

q = torch.randn(
    batch_size,
    num_tokens,
    num_qk_heads,
    head_dim,
    device="musa",
    dtype=torch.float16,
)
k = torch.randn_like(q)
v = torch.randn(
    batch_size,
    num_tokens,
    num_v_heads,
    head_dim,
    device="musa",
    dtype=torch.float16,
)

# g is log(alpha) because is_log_space defaults to True.
g = torch.zeros(
    batch_size, num_tokens, num_v_heads, device="musa", dtype=torch.float32
)
beta = torch.ones_like(g)

output, final_state = mate.gdn_prefill.chunk_gated_delta_rule(
    q=q,
    k=k,
    v=v,
    g=g,
    beta=beta,
    cu_seqlens=None,
    output_final_state=True,
)

assert output.shape == (batch_size, num_tokens, num_v_heads, head_dim)
assert final_state.shape == (
    batch_size,
    num_v_heads,
    head_dim,
    head_dim,
)
```

### Current Kernel Constraints

| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dim_k` range | ✅ Required | Native MP31 kernel currently supports `dim_k <= 128` |
| `dim_v` range | ✅ Required | Native MP31 kernel currently supports `dim_v <= 128` |
| `chunk_size` | ✅ Required | Current native path is fixed to `chunk_size == 64` to match the FlashInfer-style variant chain |
| Device | ✅ Required | MUSA on MP31 |

### Not Supported Yet (Prefill)

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-GQA/GVA head mapping | ❌ Not supported | Only the two grouped layouts above are accepted |

### Notes

- Public API entry: `mate.gdn_prefill.chunk_gated_delta_rule`.
- `use_qk_l2norm_in_kernel=True` is an in-place operation on the input Q and K tensors. Pass cloned tensors if the original unnormalized values are still needed after the call.
- Strided support is intended for fused/split QKV layouts such as a single physical `[tokens, qkv_dim]` allocation split into Q, K, and V views. Arbitrary layouts with a non-contiguous last dimension are not supported.

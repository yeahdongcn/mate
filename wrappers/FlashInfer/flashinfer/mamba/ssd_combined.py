"""Variable-length SSD combined forward, FlashInfer-compatible on MUSA.

``ssd_combined_fwd_varlen`` is the MUSA entry point that vLLM's Mamba2/SSD
implementation calls for packed variable-length prefill. Its parameter list is a
frozen contract: the names, order, and arity must not change, and callers may bind
them by position or by name. vLLM 0.28.0 binds them all by name, which is what a
live dump of the routed call showed (``MUSA_SSD_TRACE_ARGS`` in the route patch
records zero positional arguments). ``mamba_chunk_scan_combined_varlen``
is the historical alias and must stay an alias of the same object rather than a
second definition.

Upstream FlashInfer's ``ssd_combined_fwd`` (the dense, CUTLASS/CuTe-backed
entry point) is intentionally not provided here; this wrapper covers the
packed-varlen path the MUSA consumers use. MUSA-specific tuning knobs are not
added as parameters, because the surface has to stay upstream-shaped; they
belong to the MATE implementation or its environment.
